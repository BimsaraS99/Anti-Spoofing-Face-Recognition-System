# SmartFaceAuth-FaceNet â€” Real-Time Face Recognition & Verification Application

FaceCheck is a Python-based desktop application built with PyQt5 that performs real-time face detection, alignment, embedding extraction, and verification. Leveraging powerful libraries like MediaPipe, MTCNN, and FaceNet, it accurately identifies and verifies faces from live camera input or images.

The application integrates a lightweight SQLite database to store and manage face embeddings, enabling quick comparison using cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. FaceCheck is designed for user-friendly operation with informative message dialogs and seamless GUI interaction.
